# Basic/fixes:
* Functionize the printing
* Improve user.csv so that it doesn't export into one giant column
* Fix when ao3 rate limits

# Additional:
* "Popularity" of fics read (5/10)
* Canonize tags (7/10)
* Matplotlib charts of word count/hits/kudos. This one will hurt because matplotlib hurts me. Not that pandas and bs4 doesn't. (6/10)

# Unsolvable:
* Counts every time you have ever opened the fic, not just in the specified year
* Counts every fic in your history regardless of if you've read it or not (can urge user to delete works from history they haven't actually read before running to mitigate)
