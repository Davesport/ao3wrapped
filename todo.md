# Basic/fixes:
* FIX DICT SORTING - FOR LOOP DOES SORT THEM BUT IT PUTS THEM IN SORTED_DICT_LIST WHICH IS NOT USED AGAIN, ALL OF THEM STILL REFERENCE THE ORIGINALS
* Fix spaces after variable insertion when printing
* Visitations
* Functionize the printing and we can cut down like who knows a good 70 lines
* Keeks wanted mpreg fic count. Possibly expand to other "weird" fic categories like RPF and a/b/o.
* Improve user.csv so that it doesn't export into one giant column

# Additional:
* Check every fic to see if the user left a kudos on it. (4/10) Can then derive kudos rate (2/10).
* "Popularity" of fics read (5/10)
* Canonize tags (7/10)

# Unsolvable:
* Counts every time you have ever opened the fic, not just in the specified year
* Counts every fic in your history regardless of if you've read it or not (can urge user to delete works from history they haven't actually read before running to mitigate)
